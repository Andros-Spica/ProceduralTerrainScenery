# ProceduralTerrainScenery

A minimal example of the terrain and scenery loading system created for the 'Artificial Anasazi - From NetLogo to Unity' project in collaboration with Shawn Graham (Carleton University). Our aim in this project is to build a video game that allows a broader public to better understand research using ABM in Archaeology. We translated the agent-based model "Artificial Anasazi" from its versions in [NetLogo](https://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/) to C# in [Unity](https://unity3d.com/).

The terrain and scenery system allowed us to load the heightmap of a particular real-world area (the Long House Valley, Arizona, US) and populate it using a combination of procedural generation tools and the data given by the agent-based model. Here we show the basic concept which can be extended for different purposes. 

Please send us feedback or any suggestions on how to improve it. Also, comment on any bugs, general problems or doubts you may stumble upon.

See demonstration in [the project's YouTube chanel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m2l9ziAuI3w&list=PL6rJDqHXVvb4_L4VOkN5WOfFA2EXc-PCp).
